For the inception of the Le Buzz brand I was contracted to develop a web-based influencer management application with the ability to track growth and activity over a wide range of social media channels. This was realized by utilizing time-proven backend and frontend technologies as well as public APIs to quickly produce a fully-featured product which is now used by dozens of brands and customers.
