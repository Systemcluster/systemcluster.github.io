I joined Smartjobr in the beginning of 2016 to aid the development of internal analytics tools for the planned launch of their mobile app, a smart job agency for freelancers and recruiters based on intelligent tag matching. After an internal restructure I took over the role of the lead backend developer. Responsibilities included the architecture and development of the system backend software as well as its integration.
