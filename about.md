Welcome! I created this site to host and present my projects, write about ideas and progress, and to be able to refer to some sort of portfolio. Projects and articles here mainly cover the following subjects:

* Software development in C++, Rust and other languages
* Webdesign and Web application development
* Game programming and Game design 

Some of my personal and open-source projects can be found on this site or in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/systemcluster). All software and source code on this site, if not stated otherwise, is subject to the [zlib license]({{ "/license/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

You can contact me by sending an email to *info @ this domain*.
