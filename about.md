This website is authored by Christian Sdunek, a software developer from Hannover, Germany.


I created this site to host and present my projects, write about ideas and progress, and to be able to refer to some sort of portfolio. The content here consists of varying subjects regarding software development, web design, and game development. 

I am a passionate programmer with years of experience gained in education, employment, and spare time.
My main expertise includes, but is not limited to:

* Software engineering and development in C++ and other languages
* Webdesign and development of web applications
* Game programming and game design 

Some of my personal and open-source projects can be found on this site or in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/systemcluster). All software and source code on this site, if not stated otherwise, is subject to the [zlib license]({{ "/license/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
