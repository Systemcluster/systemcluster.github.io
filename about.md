This website is authored by Christian Sdunek, a software developer from Hannover, Germany.


I created this site to host and present my projects, write about ideas and progress, and to be able to refer to some sort of portfolio. The content consists of varying subjects regarding software development, web design, and game development. My main expertise includes, but is not limited to:

* C++, especially recent versions of the language
* Engineering of APIs and software applications
* Frontend web technologies and webdesign (JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, web-browser extension APIs)
* Game programming and game design (OpenGL, Unreal Engine 4, Unity3d)

Some of my personal and open-source projects can be found on this site or in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/systemcluster). All software and source code on this page, if not stated otherwise, is subject to the [zlib license]({{ "/license/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).



I am currently working on a bachelor's degree in applied computer science at the [HS Hannover](https://hs-hannover.de).
